# census_gis_ass_2

## Progress Report
- 30/3/2020 - Created the layout for SA2_2016 but the percent_under is 2011 which is wrong
- 31/3/2020 - Recreate the layout for SA2_2016 with the percend_under_20 to be 2016. Record the regions as well.

## Ideas for Suggestion
- Chose Melbourne City to see population trend and see how to develop it.
- Skate parks facilities, ping-pong, pool table, Youth Community Spaces, Basketball,Student Accomodation
